Open terminal and type ls to list working directory change directory with 
"cd nameOfTheDirectory" or "mkdir newNameOfDir" to make a directory for your 
application and then "cd nameOfTheDirectory". Now in the terminal type "npm init"
(npm is a node package manager and init refers to initialization of the package)

In our case we are creating a package.json file which has most common items and
the process is very simple as it automates suggestions 
So if you can change package name, entry point, description, author, or git rep
or else just feel free to press enter.

now that out package.json is created we can freely install some more packages such as
express, mongoose, body-parser, ejs, angular, and angular-route
json file you created
syntax will be npm install express mongoose body-parser ejs angular angular-route --save

now that out dependencies are install we can create of entry point that can be any preferable
name with extention of js
