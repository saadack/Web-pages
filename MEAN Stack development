MEAN- MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS

MongoDB- MongoDB is a non relational database which stores data in objects 
and has a unique id for each piece of dataand is flexible to use.
MongoDB is locally connected to a system and is easy to access.

ExpressJS- ExpressJS is a web app framework which enables backend functions 
to our plain JS files such as it opens a server based on RESt concept.
Representational state transfer(REST) is a way to design structure of an 
API(Application programming interface). It is naming convention for a specific
url which allows expressJS to process a particular request.

AngularJS - AngularJS enables extra functions for HTML attributes such as 
to use boolean expressions inside Document Object model(DOM).

NodeJS- NodeJS can be used on any platform and used to develop server side 
and network applications

Summary-
Developing an application using MEAN is to use AngularJS as front-end framework
and NodeJS as a backend mean while ExpressJs as a server side and MongoDB to store data
